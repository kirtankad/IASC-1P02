                  <p>
                  <h3>Team Iron Man.</h3> You are with Iron Man if you believe
                  people should be held accountable for their actions, while ensuring
                  all your motives are for the betterment of mankind. Bucky was
                  brainwashed while killing Tony's parents but I would not have
                  the same compassion Steve was demanding from Tony when Tony has
                  been incredibly vocal about what losing his parents did to him.
                  Tony was right in the team needing some supervision. He feels
                  incredibly badly for the deaths of the innocent bystanders and
                  does not want more blood on his hands. </p>

                  <h3>Team Cap.</h3> You are with Captain America if your profound
                  selflessness always puts the needs of others before your needs. All your
                  friends say you have a great sense of loyalty and you rally behind them
                  through thick and thin. Think of how many more lives would be lost if
                  The Avengers had to wait for the world to decide on if they protect
                  the world. However, Cap was completely dismissive and did not think
                  about how Tony would feel and if it was worth it to completely
                  abandon the team. They could have easily avoided it by talking
                  through it together.

                <p>The first time Spiderman was introduced into the MCU was an
                iconic moment for all of us:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  Alright, I've run out of patience. <strong>UNDEROOS!</strong>
                  ~ Tony Stark
                </blockquote>
                <p>And also, RIP to the legend, the one and only:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  Are you Mr. Stank?
                  ~ Stan Lee
                </blockquote>
