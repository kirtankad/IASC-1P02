		<p>Brock University is a public research university located in St. Catharines,
			Ontario, Canada. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
			typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
			text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
			and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It is a long established
			fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
			when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has
			a more-or-less normal distribution of letters.</p>
