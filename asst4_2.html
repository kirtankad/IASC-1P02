                    in the process of returning the infinity stones, steve decides to
                    create an alternate timeline with “peggy” and live out his life with
                    her in that timeline while actual steve of that timeline is in ice. okay
                    listen i was cool with the final dance, i think that was definitely
                    needed and it would’ve been a perfect end for steve to do that and return
                    and like give up captain america. but instead they have to destroy ALL OF
                    captain america’s character development, all of peggy carter’s character
                    development, RUIN BUCKY. it is just not something that someone like steve
                    rogers would just ever do & i'm pretty sure peggy carter would've hauled
                    america's a** back to the present because she wouldn't want him to just
                    ruin everything he's worked for & all his relationships.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    the directors hardly even gave an explanation for it and its just
                    such a let down and i still don't like how throughout the ENTIRE
                    universe & all their stories, they just completely ignored how
                    bucky had also been tragically pulled away from his family and his
                    timeline. but, no one cared & steve just abandoned him even though Steve
                    ruined his relationship with tony because of bucky & now steve has
                    abandoned bucky for peggy, who's probably moved on.
                    <strong>steve rogers deserved a better ending than this.</strong>

              Peggy deserved better than to have her future and her marriage
              chosen for her, her choice taken away by a man she didn’t even
              know so well on a personal level. yes, steve & peggy are the
              "greatest" love story ever, blah blah blah. but, peggy carter
              is a strong woman who would've hated that the guy she lowkey
              had a crush on 40 years ago, is back in her life & wanting to
              marry her without asking about what she wants from her life. </p>

             <p>
              it doesnt fit the character for steve or peggy or bucky for them
              to just abandon everything. steve was finally okay with living
              in the present & had found a family & he just left them at a point
              where absolutely everything was uncertain and there was pain. i
              think steve went back in time because of tony & nat's deaths. he
              couldnt deal with it, so he left to go back to a time where they
              were actually alive. <strong>rip tony & nat.</strong>
